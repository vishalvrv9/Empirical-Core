              <p>As of January 2017, Quill provides four tools to help students improve their writing, grammar, and proofreading skills. Each tool provides a different level of feedback for students.</p>
              <br />
              <p><strong>Quill Proofreader: One Attempt</strong></p>
              <p>In Quill Proofreader, students proofread a passage to find and correct the errors. Students are given one attempt to find the errors, and if they do not find them, they see the error highlighted in red.</p>
              <br />
              <p><strong>Quill Grammar: Two Attempts</strong></p>
              <p>Students are able to attempt each Quill Grammar question twice. If they get it right on the second attempt, students receive full credit for the question. If they answer incorrectly twice they move on to the next question.</p>
              <br />
              <p><strong>Quill Connect: Five Attempts</strong></p>
              <p>In Quill Connect, Quill's sentence combining tool, students are provided with up to five opportunities to revise their work. Students receive instant feedback after each attempt. If a student receives writes a strong answer on the first attempt, the student receives full credit. If the student writes a strong sentence after receiving feedback, the student receives partial credit. Quill Connect exercises are graded on the following logic:</p>
              <br />
              <ul>
                <li>1st Attempt: 1 Point</li>
                <li>2nd Attempt: 3/4's of a Point</li>
                <li>3rd Attempt: 1/2 of a Point </li>

              <p><strong>Quill Diagnostic: One Attempt</strong></p>
              <p>Students are not provided with any feedback on the diagnostic. Since we are using it to gauge the student's skills, we show some questions that are intentionally difficult to assess their needs. Students do not see their scores at the end, and every student earns a 100% score for a Quill Diagnostic exercise on the dashboard.</p>

                                                       answer: "<p>The Common Core State Standards do not always map onto the development stages of students. For example, we have found that our 2nd grade CCSS materials are popular among middle schools. Relative pronouns, a 4th grade CCSS concept, are often taught in high schools. Using the word stage, instead of grade level, reinforces the concept that each student will learn grammar at her or his own pace.</p>"

                    <br />
                    <p>Quill uses various subdomains, and Firebase to store data, so please whitelist *.quill.org as well as *.firebaseio.com.As of August 2016, Google has issued a new SSL certificate for all apps hosted by Firebase, causing issues with firewalls like FortiGate. AwesomeTable discovered this issue, and we've copied their explanation and solution below:The issue appears to be linked to the number of SANs in the certificate, which is almost a thousand. We don't know if Google is going to change something here.If you are a Fortinet user, you can enable/check \"Inspect All Ports\" in Policy & Objects > Policy > SSL/SSH Inspection > [your policy]. Explanation: when \"Inspect All Ports\" is DISABLED (you're scanning specific ports), the FortiGate's proxyworker process is doing the SSL Inspection. The proxyworker isn't able to handle all of those SANs. However, if \"Inspect All Ports\" is ENABLED, SSL Inspection gets offloaded to the IPS Module, which is able to handle that number of SANs just fine.Another solution is to write firewall rules to allow traffic with no certificate inspection for cdn.firebase.com (151.101.44.249), firebase.com and quill.org.You can test Firebase access here https://www.firebase.com/test.html</p>
