Most of my third grade students come into class with a conspicuous gap in their writing and typing skills. My third graders often struggle to use correctly the small parts of speech that the majority of us take for granted -- for instance, "a," "an," "the," and "this."

### Summary

I rely on the introductory pack with determiners to provide my students with extra practice every day, both in grammar and in typing skills. When the students start on the first level, they feel encouraged to learn how to write correctly while typing correctly. Furthermore, it’s certainly helpful to have students read passages and engage in  activities related to history--doing so expands their knowledge about the world around them. 


### Activity Info

The students wholeheartedly appreciate having a tool that combines typing, writing, and reading. Now, the students manage to concentrate on the task at hand and sharpen the specific skills they struggle with. I''ve seen a lot of improvement in the use of determiners in my classes. 

It''s also just awesome that the students love the passages and the sentences. They feel like they learn something new every time they go on Quill.

It’s quite difficult for students to understand how to use plural nouns and possessives--unless, of course, they receive instruction and regularly practice how to do so, in many different iterations. Although I often went over the rules that govern this part of language, when it came to applying these concepts  in their writing, my students seemed to forget quickly! 

### Summary

When I noticed that my students could certainly use more practice, I decided to assign activities through Quill, aiming to train students in skills ranging from using apostrophes to distinguishing between to and too. For the high-performing students, Quill serves as a fun warm-up;  for the low-performing students, it’s an effective follow-up tool to reinforce direct teacher instruction. Therefore, I assign different levels of activities to students, depending on their readiness.

### Activity Info

 I’ve seen that Quill activities can prove remarkably helpful for reinforcing simple concepts that are easy to forget. Grammar can be tedious, but students are more engaged with the concepts when practicing using Quill, and I’ve been able to tailor further instruction to each student. Students find the Quill activities fun to use, and they’re learning quicker than before, especially due to the immediate feedback they receive through the program.

In terms of proficiency and writing ability, many of my students fall behind their peers. Since each student exhibits a different level of proficiency, it can be quite the challenge to individualize classroom instruction. 


### Summary

In my classes, I’ve placed students in different reading blocks, using Quill’s summative assessments to gauge which areas deserve their attention. I then assign Quill activities, which each student needs to have done by the end of the week. With Quill Premium, I can track my students even better and recognize which areas they understand completely and which areas they don’t. 

I’ve found the summative assessments easy to use, and my students enjoy working on them. With interesting passages and immediate feedback, Quill makes my students truly feel they’re learning.


### Activity Info

Since implementing Quill in my classroom, I have seen some major improvements in my students. Quill has helped improve students’ typing skills extensively, and I appreciate that the activities offer them the opportunity to fix their mistakes. The students have realized the importance of every mark they make and have become more aware as they are writing.

One of the toughest concepts to master as an ESL student is sentence structure, particularly recognizing parallel structure and distinguishing between active voice and passive voice. Without those necessary skills, my students struggle to formulate impactful writing. Writing  powerful, compelling sentences is essential for students to succeed throughout middle and high school. But writing those types of sentences proves difficult for my ESL students. With Quill, my students practice writing sentences that are structured for maximum effect.


### Summary

At the beginning of the year, my students were only able to write using the basic fundamentals of the English language. By the end of the year, however--after using Quill on a regular basis--my students were able to write essays with consistent tone throughout and even intentionally use parallel structure to their advantage. 


### Activity Info

One student, Martina, wrote an essay on "Brave New World" and used this sentence: “Huxley presents readers with complacent characters who eat, sleep, and live their lives under the watch of the World State.” I shared it with the rest of the class to show as a fantastic example of her first steps to powerful writing. It’s no coincidence that she enjoyed avidly practicing her writing skills on Quill.

My students were eighth grade ELA, and each of them exhibited a different level of proficiency in writing, particularly in using commas correctly. Often, they’d struggle to remember to place commas in lists or after introductory prepositional phrases. Their sentences were largely short and choppy -- it’d be upsetting to witness them work so hard on their assignments yet still be unable to articulate their thoughts in a coherent manner. 


### Summary

They enjoyed the Quill activities and made remarkable strides in their writing abilities. By the end of the semester, my students were consistently writing far more complex sentences. By prompting my students to practice their comma usage, Quill truly helped them improve their writing.

### Activity Info

One of my students, Felipe, who had initially struggled to write the most basic of sentences, was able to write the following sentences after using Quill throughout the year: “The author used analogy, simile, and metaphor to make his characters come alive. However, it was the dialogue in the short story that truly showed the depth of the protagonist.” I knew Felipe had enjoyed the book we were reading, but to see him express those ideas on paper like that was simply extraordinary.

I’m a seventh- and eighth-grade Special Education teacher at KIPP DC: KEY Academy in Washington, DC. The students in my classroom have a varying set of disabilities, but one common factor unites them: their boundless passion for learning. Like many middle schoolers, my kids mistake "too" for "to," or "their" for "they’re," or even "Greece" for "grease." While these errors are quite silly, they will certainly hurt them in the long run. My students, therefore, need to fix these errors before moving on to high school. 

Typically, my students rush through their work, not focusing intently on the activity at hand. Those with ADHD or ADD may quickly complete an assignment but fail to discern the correct word to incorporate in a sentence. At the beginning of the year, students would even use the wrong verb form like, “Johnny and Sally is going the store.”


### Summary

Over the past three years, I’ve actively depended on Quill to teach grammatical concepts and supplement the class materials in both my classes. Students are enthusiastic to use the program and are quick to celebrate getting a “green square” denoting that they’ve passed an assigned skill. I have full control of what areas of grammar the students are working on and the pace with which they complete levels . And  the instant feedback, of course, is incredibly helpful. 


### Activity Info

Kids are obsessed with Quill. Students love to see how many skills they’ve completed in a week and even start competitions amongst themselves to determine who can complete the most skills with the highest accuracy. I’ve undoubtedly seen tremendous progress in their writing skills. 

I had one student, Darian, an ADHD learner, who was always excited about his Quill activities. He used to come into school early to get extra time on the computer to do his lessons. One afternoon, he finished his lessons early and went around to other students to help them with their Quill activities. I hadn’t ever seen Darian so social before! It was amazing to see his writing progress as well as his high level of engagement with the tasks at hand.

In my classroom, Quill serves as quite the multi-purpose tool. Some students rely on Quill as a way to hone their skills upon completing the class exercises early; after all, I know that roughly 20% of my students will finish their assignments before the end of the period, so Quill can keep them occupied. Others see Quill as a guiding hand that helps clarify concepts that may otherwise seem unclear. I even use Quill as a “bell-ringer,” a ten-minute activity that I assign students towards the beginning of class, prompting them to adopt a classroom mindset. On most days, every single one of my classes is on Quill. 


### Activity Info

In order to personalize classroom instruction, I now look to Quill to provide each student with a specific activity to start class with and one end class with. I’m looking forward to utilizing Quill even more frequently in the upcoming school year. Students love using Quill since it truly lets them move at their own pace and receive instant  feedback on their work.

My high school students don’t speak English very well, yet they’re all quite intelligent and aspire to attend college. Irregular verbs are their nemeses. My students struggle with conjugating verbs and expressing the present tense and the past tense. One of my students, for instance, habitually wrote sentences like, “Last week, I dig holes in the garden for my mother’s flowers.” It’s frustrating for me, but even more so for my students: people will judge them harshly for not fully comprehending how to shift tenses.


### Summary

Quill afforded my students the valuable opportunity to practice their English writing without suffering the burdensome social pressure to be correct every time. During the year, they’d tend to come up to me and thank me for introducing them to Quill. 


### Activity Info

By the end of the year, that same student who initially encountered difficulty in using tenses became the consistent high-scorer on our in-class grammar activities and assessments. Once she knew that she could master verbs, she felt that anything was possible. All of my students left the class with a newfound confidence that they could use irregular past tense verbs appropriately to tell their story. Quill enabled me to reinforce concepts to practice and to track their progress through the program.

This pack will guide students to take multiple short, choppy sentences and combine them to form more complex, well-structured sentences. As the content of these sentence-combining exercises revolves around weather and climate, students can gain deeper insight into science while also strengthening their writing skills.

This pack consists of 3 activities with 5-7 questions in each.

In the Starter activity, students will combine two sentences to create one new sentence that contains an adjective.

In the Intermediate activity, students will combine three sentences to create a sentence with an adjective and an adverb.

In the Advanced activity, students will combine three, four, and sometimes five sentences to create one new sentence using lists, adjectives, and modifying phrases.
