  off some of the excess pressure. Despite the danger of the maneuver, Leonov managed
  to release enough pressure {+that-where|110} he was able to safely re-enter the
  rocket.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOnce Leonov was back inside the craft, the two cosmonauts {+then-than|207}
  worked {+quickly-quick|86} to prepare their ship to return to earth. What the men
  did not anticipate was how difficult it would be to maneuver {+themselves-himself|69}
  inside the rocket while wearing {+their-there|212} bulky spacesuits. As a result,
  they took an additional 46 seconds to get the {+ship''s-ships|165} center of gravity
  into the correct position to re-enter earth''s atmosphere. The delay caused the ship
  to fly off course, and the two men landed in the inhospitable Soviet tundra.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen
  the craft landed, the forest cover was so dense that the {+Soviets-Soviet''s|228}
  could not land helicopters in the area. The two cosmonauts had to spend the night
  out in the forest in -45C weather. The next morning, the two {+cosmonauts-Cosmonauts|10}
  awoke to a Soviet search and rescue squad, who transported them back to base. Despite
  the problems that arose during the mission, as well as the risky solutions the men
  were forced to employ, both Leonov and Belyayev survived the ordeal. As a result,
  both men became national heroes who are still celebrated to this day. \"

  the {+Apollo-apollo|134} rocket and the {+Soyuz-soyuz|134} rocket launched perfectly.
  \\ The two rockets met up in space, and the crews toured each others ships.  When
  the meet up was done, the crews separated their ships and safely returned back to
  earth.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the {+Apollo/Soyuz-apollo/soyuz|134} Test Project was successfully
  completed, both {+America-america|134} and the {+USSR-ussr|134} began working together
  to build space stations.  In fact, the Mir Space Station that orbited earth in the
  1990''s, and the {+International Space Station-international space station|134} (ISS)
  that is orbiting us right now, are both based on Apollo/Soyuz design.  The project
  went so well that it started a new period of cooperation and trust between America

  build the maze alone, so he asked the smartest man in Greece, a man named Daedalus,
  to build a maze that nobody could escape from. Daedalus built the maze and named
  it the Labyrinth. Then Daedalus and King Minos {+themselves-(herself / themselves)|142}
  threw the Minotaur inside. From then on, every seven years, seven men and seven
  women were sent into the Labyrinth to feed the Minotaur.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur hero, Theseus,
  grew up in Athens and was tired of seeing his friends sail off and never return.
  One day, Theseus decided to go to Crete, disguised as one of the seven men, and
  kill the beast. When Theseus and the others got to Crete, they were told to wait
  by the Labyrinth for King Minos to arrive.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the King arrived, he had
  his daughter Ariadne with him. When Ariadne saw Theseus, she fell in love with him.
  She told Theseus that he needed her help, she {+herself-(itself / herself)|142}
  had the key to solving the maze. The Labyrinth {+itself-(themselves / itself)|142}
  was not dangerous, but it was very easy to lose your way. She gave him a ball of
  string so he could tell where he had already been. Using the string, Theseus bravely
  explored the Labyrinth until he found the Minotaur. After a long and hard fight,
  Theseus killed the Minotaur, and shouted, \\\"I have slain the beast {+myself!\\\"-(myself!\\\"
  / yourself!\\\")|142} Once the Minotaur was dead, the terror was over for all the
  men and women in Greece.\"
