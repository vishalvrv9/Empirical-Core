  Quill is a nonprofit, educational technology organization dedicated to
  strengthening student writing. Quill provides 10-15 minute exercises that
  help students build sentence construction skills. Students will receive
  specific, automatic feedback and hints to help students improve it. The
  personalized, immediate responses to student submissions enable students to
  build their writing skills quickly, and allow teachers to prioritize
  data-driven intervention by removing the need for hours of grading.
</p>
<p>
  Here is a quick summary of what you can do as a co-teacher:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Manage your class and edit students</li>
  <li>Assign activities to the class</li>
  <li>Launch Quill Lessons with class</li>
  <li>View diagnostic and basic reporting</li>
