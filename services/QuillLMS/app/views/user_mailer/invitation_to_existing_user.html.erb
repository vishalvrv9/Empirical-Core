<p>
  Hi <%= @email_hash['invitee_first_name'] %>,
</p>
<p>
  <%= @email_hash['inviter_name'] %> has just invited you to co-teach the following
  <%= 'class'.pluralize(@email_hash['classroom_names'].length) %> on Quill:
</p>
<ul>
  <% @email_hash['classroom_names'].each do |name| %>
    <li><%= name %></li>
  <% end %>
</ul>
<p>
  <%= link_to 'You can accept this invitation via the Manage Classes page.', @email_hash['accept_link'] %>
</p>
  <p></p>
<p>
  Once you accept the invitation, you will see
  <%= @email_hash['classroom_names'].length > 1 ? 'these classes' : 'this class' %>
  on your teacher dashboard and under Active Classes on the Manage Classes page.
</p>
<p>
  To learn more about co-teaching,
  <%= link_to 'here is an article', @email_hash['support_article_link'] %>
  that explains everything you need to know.
</p>
<p>
  Enjoy,
