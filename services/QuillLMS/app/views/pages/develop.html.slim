  h3 Open Development
  p Quill is pioneering an innovative model of content creationâ€”open development. The core idea of open development is that everyone can contribute to and reuse the design, materials, and code of our site. By sharing work on the web, people can collaboratively build monumental projects.


  h3 Open Design
  p How can we improve Quill? Our goal is to create digital tools that build confident writers, and we'd like to hear your ideas. We take each idea seriously as we are looking to pool the collective knowledge of teachers into a single literacy platform.
