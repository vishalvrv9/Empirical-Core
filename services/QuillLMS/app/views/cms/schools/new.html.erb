    <h2>New School</h2>
    <br />
    <p><strong>Warning: Before you add a school, be sure to search for it via zipcode. Only add a school if you're certain it doesn't already exist.</strong></p>
    <br /><strong>Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>State is just initials (e.g. NY)</li>
      <li>Private schools don't have a district.</li>
      <li>Charter schools should have the charter network name as district.</li>
      <li>Before adding a district, search for other schools in the same district so you can copy and paste the exact district name in the database.</li>
      <li>Free and Reduced Price lunch is just a number (e.g. 75 &mdash; not 75%).</li>
    </strong></ul>
