# Nav Bars

## Generic Tabs
The generic tabs are somewhat responsive. There is a hamburger dropdown version, but it won't work in the style-guide.
Adding a class of active to an ``li`` element will add the green border to the top and turn the background white.

We have an erb partial for building these (_generic_tabs.erb)-- simply pass in a hash as is done in
_tools_tabs.html.erb, along with the name of the active link, and it will be generated for you.

The partial also takes an optional param of @mobile. Set it to true if you want a hamburger
dropdown as well -- however, be aware that you will almost certainly need to set custom
breakpoints to fit the view's needs.


```
<div class="q-nav-bar">
  <ul class='desktop-nav-list'>
      <li class='active' >
        <a href="/">Tools</a>
      <li>
        <a href="/">Resources</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="/">Lessons</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="/">Reports</a>
      </li>
  </ul>

</div>
```
